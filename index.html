    <h2 style="text-align: center;">History of HTTP</h2>
    <p><span></span> HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the underlying protocol of the World Wide Web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee and his team between 1989-1991, HTTP has seen many changes, keeping most of the simplicity and further shaping its flexibility. HTTP has evolved from an early protocol to exchange files in a semi-trusted laboratory environment, to the modern maze of the Internet, now carrying images, videos in high resolution and 3D.</p>
    <p><span>*</span>HTTP functions as a request–response protocol in the client–server computing model.</p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Versions of HTTP</h2>
    <p>
        <h4>HTTP/0.9 — The One-line Protocol</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Initial version of HTTP — a simple client-server, request-response, telenet-friendly protocol</li>
            <li>Request nature: single-line (method + path for requested document)</li>
            <li>Methods supported: GET only</li>
            <li>Response type: hypertext only</li>
            <li>Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response</li>
            <li>No HTTP headers (cannot transfer other content type files), No status/error codes, No URLs, No versioning</li>
            <p><span>*</span>Popular web servers (Apache, Nginx) still supports HTTP/0/9. Try opening up a Telnet session and accessing google.com</p>

        </ul>
        <h4>HTTP/1.0 — Building extensibility</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Browser-friendly protocol</li>
            <li>Provided header fields including rich metadata about both request and response (HTTP version number, status code, content type)</li>
            <li>Response: not limited to hypertext (Content-Type header provided ability to transmit files other than plain HTML files — e.g. scripts, stylesheets, media)</li>
            <li>Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST</li>
            <li>Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>HTTP/1.1 — The standardized protocol</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>This is the HTTP version currently in common use.</li>
            <li>Introduced critical performance optimizations and feature enhancements — persistent and pipelined connections, chunked transfers, compression/decompression, content negotiations, virtual hosting (a server with a single IP Address hosting multiple domains), faster response and great bandwidth savings by adding cache support.</li>
            <li>Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , DELETE , TRACE , OPTIONS</li>
            <li>Connection nature: long-lived</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>HTTP/2</h4>
        <p>HTTP/2 will make our applications faster, simpler, and more robust—a rare combination—by allowing us to undo many of the HTTP/1.1 workarounds previously done within our applications and address these concerns within the transport layer itself. Even better, it also opens up a number of entirely new opportunities to optimize our applications and improve performance!</p>
